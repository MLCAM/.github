<h1>CamAI</h1>

Our product ‘<b>CamAI</b>’ is simple, we want to add more processing power to CCTV’s through Microprocessors such as Raspi, such that we can run ML models on them which is now possible as of ‘<b>TINY ML</b>’. This helps us automate tasks at ease such as attendance, violence detection & mask detection as well.
